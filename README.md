webwxApp SPA Html &amp; AngularJS Script Tracker for Web Wechat

# Introduction

The purpose of creating this repository is to track the code change from https://wx.qq.com , which can make the [PuppetWeb of Wechaty](https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty/blob/master/src/puppet-web/) life easier in the future.

What it is doing is:

1. Save https://wx.qq.com HTML to `orignal/index.html`
1. Save AngularJs JavsScript to `orignal/wxwebApp.js`
1. Format the above two files, and save them to `formatted/`
1. Check wether there has any update
1. Commit to Git Repository and use js file name as commit message(if updated)

# Case Study

I have a webwxApp.js which was saved on May 2016, about 5 months ago before I setup this tracker.

1. After I finished this tracker, I got a diff on webwxApp between version May to Nov, you can see, there's no much change at the past half year:

  https://github.com/wechaty/webwx-app-tracker/commit/ab292418e2651ec7e2630da156b3c18f0dca26fd

2. However there was a new little bug introduced in, it's a typo of `API_webwxsendmsgvedio`:

  https://github.com/wechaty/webwx-app-tracker/commit/ab292418e2651ec7e2630da156b3c18f0dca26fd#diff-80c9da80c8ca080b37c6c49864880646R3300

Enjoy it!
